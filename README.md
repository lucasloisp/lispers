# Lispers

A [Build Your Own Lisp](http://www.buildyourownlisp.com) inspired
implementation of a toy language in Rust.

Currently simple arithmetic is implemented (integer operations) as well as
basic list-manipulation capabilities.

## About the project

All features are tested before implementation. The idea is to follow TDD
methodology to ensure correctly functioning code as well as guiding
implementation decisions. 

The tests can be run the usual way, by running

```
cargo run
```
